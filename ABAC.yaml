  ABAC System Implementation Summary

  ✅ Complete ABAC System Successfully Implemented and Running

  🏗️ Core Components Implemented:

  1. Models & Enums (models.py):
    - Policy, PolicyRule, Condition structures
    - ABAC Context for all attributes
    - Policy effects (PERMIT/DENY)
    - Condition operators (equals, contains, regex, etc.)
  2. Policy Engine (engine.py):
    - Evaluates complex conditions with nested AND/OR/NOT logic
    - Supports dynamic attribute resolution
    - Priority-based rule evaluation
    - Performance tracking
  3. Attribute Providers (attributes.py):
    - Subject (user) attributes extraction
    - Resource attributes from URLs/requests
    - Action attributes (CRUD mapping)
    - Environment attributes (time, IP, business hours)
  4. FastAPI Middleware (middleware.py):
    - Automatic ABAC enforcement on all endpoints
    - Request/response context handling
    - Exclusion paths for health checks
  5. Default Policies (default_policies.py):
    - Basic user access policies
    - Admin full access
    - Resource ownership rules
    - Business hours restrictions
    - Department-based access
    - IP-based restrictions

  🧪 Testing Results:

  - ✅ Application starts successfully
  - ✅ 6 ABAC policies loaded automatically
  - ✅ Database connection established
  - ✅ Authenticated requests work (/api/v1/users/me, /api/v1/documents)
  - ✅ Unauthenticated requests properly denied (403)
  - ✅ Admin endpoints protected (/api/v1/admin/users denied for non-admin)
  - ✅ Document access controlled by sensitivity level
  - ✅ ABAC context and decisions available via debug endpoint

  🎯 Key Features:

  - Enterprise-grade policy engine with complex condition evaluation
  - FastAPI middleware for automatic enforcement
  - Attribute-based access control (user, resource, action, environment)
  - Performance optimized with millisecond evaluation times
  - Extensible policy system with priority handling
  - Production-ready with proper error handling and logging

  The ABAC system is now fully operational at http://127.0.0.1:8080 with comprehensive access control protecting
  your Corely enterprise application!
